# factor-modelling
A project exploring the predictive power of modern alpha factors using machine learning. It builds a modular pipeline that ingests fundamental and price data, constructs linear and nonlinear alpha factors, evaluates them with forward Information Coefficient (IC), and ranks them for long-short portfolio simulation.
