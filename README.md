# Alpha Factor Research: ML-Based Factor Evaluation Pipeline

This repository contains a modular Python pipeline to research and evaluate the predictive power of various linear and nonlinear alpha factors using free financial data. It aims to reflect realistic constraints in quant research â€” no premium data feeds, no real-time execution, and runs entirely locally.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Research modern alpha factors using free fundamental and price data
- Implement machine learning models to extract nonlinear factor structure
- Measure factor effectiveness using forward Information Coefficient (IC)
- Simulate basic long-short strategies using top-ranked alpha signals
- Modularize the codebase for easy extension with new models, features, and datasets
